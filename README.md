<h1>Weapon Zeroing and Warriors' Range Efficieny Analysis System of Small Arms for Bangladesh Army</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>One of the most important aspects of basic soldering is weapon efficiency and its analysis. Weapon zeroing and its analysis is two major domains that works as a benchmark for achieving the goal of weapon training. Zeroing, or sighting in, a rifle is the process of aligning the sights on the weapon with the rifle so you can accurately aim at your target from a set distance. That means, to adjust the front sight tip or the back sight U of the weapon so that the bullet hits the point of aim.</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>The objectives of the hardware along with the software are as follows:
<ul>
<li>Making an effective zeroing tool to improve the accuracy of the firer thereby development of consistent shot firer will be ensured.</li>
<li>To allow the sub unit commanders a scope of monitoring the results, and thereby the supervisors will be able to provide necessary correction for specific firers</li>
<li>Making a database for firers to allow tracking of methodological development of firing standards thus individual interest and responsibilities will be improved.</li>
<li>Minimizing the system loss by implementing application based target checking method which will incorporate AI for precision, and thereby human fatigue will be reduced, error detection, and MPI calculation will be automatic.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Target Users</h2>
<p>Bangladesh Army is the target user of this hardware and software. It is designed to zero the BD-08 rifle of BD Army and the software to calculate the MPI of target along with the efficiency analysis of the firer.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Weapon Zeroing is the process of bringing accuracy and correction in weapon. The system will automate the process of zeroing. The following features are included:
<ul>
<li>Target Analysis: The bullet pierced targetâ€™s image will be collected using camera which will be processed using the mobile application incorporated in the system. The application will identify the bullet piercing holes in the target and calculate the MPI value for weapon zeroing. MPI is calculated from the firing impact created on target. The firer fires 5 bullets in the target. </li>
<li>Data Storage: The data collecting from image process will be storage in the web server which will be reference for analysis of performance of the soldiers. Besides, the data stored will be displayed to the commander to judge the performance of the soldiers. </li>
<li>Data Analysis: The data collected in server will be analyzed to determine the range efficiency of the soldier. This data will be also used to analyze the firing efficiency of the firer. That is error can be generated due to weapon or due to the inefficiency of firer. Here the analyzed data can find out whether the error is due to weapon or the firer.</li>
<li>Weapon Zeroing: The data (MPI) collected from image processing is used to zero the weapon. The weapon set at weapon zeroing tool will use its motors which will rotate to zero the weapon. Once it is done, the firer will check the weapon by firing and testing it.</li>
<li>Firer Profile Management: The firers will have their individual profiles which will carry their own firing data. It will help them to determine their efficiency of firing based on the result analyzed by the system.</li>
</ul>
